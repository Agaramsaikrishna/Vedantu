### Acids, Bases, and Salts
Imagine you're in a kitchen, and you accidentally spill some lemon juice on your skin. It stings, right? That's because lemon juice is acidic. On the other hand, if you were to touch a soap bar, it would feel slippery and not sting at all. This is because soap is a base.
